In Objective-C, a rare but perplexing issue can arise from the interaction between KVO (Key-Value Observing) and memory management.  Specifically, if an observer is deallocated before the observed object removes it, a crash can occur. This is because the observed object attempts to send a message to a deallocated observer, leading to a EXC_BAD_ACCESS error.  This is often subtle because the crash might not happen immediately, only when the observed object triggers the KVO notification.
